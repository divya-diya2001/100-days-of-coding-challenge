## Write a program that reads the length of the base and the height of a right-angled triangle and prints the area. Every number is given on a separate line.

# Read the numbers b and h like this:
h = int(input())
b = int(input())
# Print the result with print()
print(b*h/2)

```
## input
3
5

## output
