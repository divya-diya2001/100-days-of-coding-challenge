## Write a program that reads an integer number and prints its previous and next numbers. See the example below.

```
# Read an integer:
a = int(input())
# Print a value:
b = int(a+1)
c = int(a-1)
# printing the next and previous numbers
print("the next number for the number" + str(a) +"is" +str(b))
print("the previous number for the number " +str(a) +"is" +str(c))

```
```
Example input
179

Example output
The next number for the number 179 is 180
The previous number for the number 179 is 178
